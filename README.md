# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there 

I'm a creative designer and developer with over 15 years of experience, having worked with clients such as 38 Studios, Bank of America, Dunkin' Donuts, Frontier Communications, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Party City, and the Steamship Authority. I lead projects on digital experiences, focusing on MACH principles, and consistently deliver results that exceed expectations, within budget, and on time. I currently work at [Stellar Elements](https://stellarelements.com) as a Principal Solution Architect, where I understand our client's business and needs, and then bring it all together with an efficient, scalable, secure technology stack and actionable game plan.
